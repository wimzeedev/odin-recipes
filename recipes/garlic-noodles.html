      <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This spicy fusion of umami soy and oyster sauces and Parmesan cheese will have you reaching for thirds and fourths.</p>
      
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 lb spaghetti</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter, <i>unsalted</i></li>
        <li>8 garlic cloves, <i>minced</i></li>
        <li>2 tsp chili flakes</li>
        <li>1/3 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/3 cup oyster sauce</li>
        <li>6 tbsp Parmesan cheese, <i>finely grated</i></li>
      </ul>
      <p><i>Garlic oil:</i></p>
      <ul>
        <li>1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>6 garlic cloves, finely sliced</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>To make the garlic oil, place the oil and the garlic in a small saucepan over medium heat. Once the garlic is sizzling, cook for 2-3 minutes or until the garlic is just starting to turn golden at the edges. Transfer to a heat-proof bowl and set aside for later (the garlic will continue cooking and turn evenly golden in the bowl).</li>
        <li>Heat a large pot of salted water over high heat. When boiling rapidly, add the pasta and cook until al dente.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, add the butter, garlic and chilli flakes into a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Cook stirring until the butter is just melted (you want the garlic to soften but not colour), then add the soy sauce and oyster sauce. Simmer for a minute and then take off the heat until the pasta is cooked.</li>
        <li>When the pasta is al dente, reserve a cup of pasta cooking liquid in case you need it later. Place the butter sauce back on the heat and add the pasta straight into the pan. Cook, stirring, for 3-4 minutes or until the liquid has been absorbed by the pasta and everything is looking super glossy and thick. Toss through the parmesan cheese (add a little pasta cooking water here if necessary). Divide among serving plates. Top with a drizzle of garlic oil and some garlic chips. Sprinkle with spring onion and add extra cheese.</li>
      </ol>
